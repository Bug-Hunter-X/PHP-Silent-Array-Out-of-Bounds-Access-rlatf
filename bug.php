This code suffers from a silent failure when attempting to access an array element using an index that's out of bounds.  PHP doesn't throw an error in this scenario; it simply returns null, leading to unexpected behavior and making debugging difficult.

```php
<?php
$myArray = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

// Accessing index 3, which is out of bounds
$value = $myArray[3];

if ($value) {
  echo "Value: " . $value;
} else {
  echo "Value is null or empty";
}
?>
```

The `if ($value)` check won't reliably detect the problem because `null` evaluates to false in a boolean context, making it indistinguishable from an empty string or 0.
